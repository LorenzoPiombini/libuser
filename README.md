# Uniuser A Small User Management Library for Linux

`uniuser` is a lightweight C library designed to programmatically manage users on a Linux operating system. It provides a simple function, `add_user(char *username, char *password)`,  
allowing you to create users securely without relying on shell exposure or risky system calls like `system()`, `popen()`, or the `exec` family.

## Features
- Add users programmatically with `add_user()`.
- Avoids unsafe shell interactions for better security.
- Includes additional utilities like `del_user()`, `create_group()`, and `edit_group_user()` (see [main.c] for examples).

[main.c]: src/main.c 
- Comes with a test program, `user_manager`, to demonstrate functionality.


## API endpoint

```c
int crypt_pswd(char *paswd, char **hash,char *salt);
int add_user(char *username, char *paswd, char *full_name);
int login(char *username, char *passwd, int mod);
int get_user_info(char *username, struct user_info *ui); 
int del_user(char *username, int mod);
int create_group(char* group_name);
int del_group(char *group_name);
int edit_group_user(char *username, char *group_name, int mod);
int paswd_chk(char *passwrd,int rules);
int list_group(char *username, char **list);
```

## Prerequisites
- A Linux-based operating system.
- Root privileges (`sudo`) for building and testing.
- GCC and standard C development tools (`make`, `git`, etc.).
- libCrypt

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LorenzoPiombini/uniuser.git
```


## Build and Install

Navigate to the cloned directory and run the following commands to configure and build the library:

```bash
$ cd uniuser
$ ./configure
$ sudo make build
```

This will compile the library and install it on your system, along with a test program called `user_manager`.
Keep in mind that now you have a binary containing the asan library because the artifact has been compiled  
with the flag -fsanitize=address. I use this to spots some memory leaks 
that aren't that easy to spot with other tools.

lib asan make the binary bigger, so if you need a smaller binary for production you can run:
```bash
$ sudo make build_prod
```
this will install the library on your machine, and the test program will be called `user_manager_prod`, 
both without lib asan.
  
## Using the Library in Your Code

Once installed, you can include the library in your C projects. Below is a basic example:

```c    
#include "uniuser.h"

int main(void) {
    char *username = "testuser";
    char *password = "securepassword";

    if (add_user(username, password) < 1000) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Failed to add user '%s'\n", username);
        return 1;
    }

    printf("User '%s' added successfully!\n", username);
    return 0;
}
```

## Return Values

These are the errors that endpoints can return:
```plain text
EMAX_G      /*exeed the maximum gid number*/ 
EMAX_U      /*exeed the maximum user number*/
EALRDY_U    /*user already exist*/
ESGID       /*SUB_GID_MAX overflowed */
ESUID       /*SUB_UID_MAX overflowed */
ECHAR       /* passowrd contain KILL or ERASE system char */
ENONE_U     /* user does not exist */
EALRDY_GU   /*group already added to user*/
ERR_GU      /*error in delating the group*/
ENONE_GU    /*the user is not assign to this group */
EALRDY_G    /*group already exist*/
ENONE_G     /*the group  does not exist*/
```

all the fucntions could return a generic error -1,and a message will be display to the console.

`add_user()` returns a value â‰¥ 1000 on success (UID).
values < 1000 indicate an error wich will be one of the follwing:
- `EMAX_U`
- `EALRDY_U`
- `ESGID`
- `ESUID`


`del_user` returns 0 on success.
erros :
- `ENONE_U`

`del_group()` returns 0 on success.
erros :
- `ENONE_G`

`edit_group_user()` returns 0 on success.
erros :
- `ENONE_G`
- `ENONE_U`

`create_group()` returns 0 on success.
erros :
- `EALRDY_G`
- `EMAX_G`

## Security

the library comes with builtin checks for the password, by default the password provided won't be checked  
against any of this criteria, you can use the `pswd_chk()` like this: 

```c
	int p_chk = paswd_chk(paswd,RULE_ON);
	if(p_chk == 0 || p_chk == -1) {
		fprintf(stderr,"password does not meet security criteria.\n");
		return -1;	
	} else if (p_chk == ECHAR) {
		fprintf(stderr,"password contains invalid characters.\n");
		return -1;
	}

```

the code snipped checks for a password that must meet the following:   
- 8 character long
- one capital letter
- one special character (like @)
- contain a number

the function checks also if the password contains kill or erase chars  
you can turn off this security criteria by passing to the `paswd_chk()` endpoint the parameter RULE_OFF  
this way the program will check only for kill char `^U` or erase char `^?` which they might create problems if you
decide to echo passwords, or in some embedded systems.
